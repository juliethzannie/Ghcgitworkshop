- Undoing changes with `revert` and `reset`
- Making commits
- Pushing and pulling changes
- Creating pull requests
- Using `cherry-pick`

## 🔁 Mini Lab 1 – Rebase

### 1.1 – Introduction to Basic Rebase

Rebase a simple feature branch onto `main`. Learn how to bring your branch up to date without creating a merge commit, maintaining a linear history.

### 1.2 – Rebase Onto Updated Main with Multiple Conflicts

Use `git rebase` to apply changes from a feature branch onto an updated `main` branch. Learn how to handle and resolve multiple merge conflicts during the rebase process.

### 1.3 – Interactive Rebase with Conflict Resolution

Use interactive rebase to squash, reorder, and edit commit messages. You'll encounter and resolve a conflict during the squash process, giving you practice in cleaning up commit history while handling conflicts.

## 🔀 Mini Lab 2 – Merge

### 2.1 – Introduction to Git Merge

Learn how merging works in Git using simple branches that haven’t diverged significantly. You'll create a new branch, make a few changes, and then merge it back into `main`, exploring fast-forward and non-fast-forward merges.

### 2.2 – Merge Conflict During Feature Integration

Simulate a merge conflict by modifying the same lines on `main` and a feature branch. You'll identify the conflict, resolve it manually, and complete the merge. This lab also covers how to stage resolved files and abort the merge if needed.

### 2.3 – Selective Merging with Git Cherry Pick

Learn how to apply specific commits from one branch to another using `git cherry-pick`. This technique is useful when a full merge is not desired but certain changes need to be brought over. You’ll practice picking individual commits and compare this approach with merging.

## 🧠 Tip

Each lab will include hands-on exercises. Use the Git CLI and your preferred editor (e.g., VS Code) to follow along. Make sure to read the instructions in each lab folder.

Happy rebasing and merging! 🎉
